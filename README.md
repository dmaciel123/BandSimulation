# BandSimulation
 
This package is used for simulating the bands of remote sensors based on they respective Spectral Response Functions (SRF) / Relative Spectral Response (RSR). The satellites/sensors added to this package are: 

Landsat-5/TM

Landsat-7/ETM+

Landsat-8/OLI

Sentinel-2/MSI A and B

Sentinel-3/OLCI

PlanetScope SuperDove

The Spectral Response Functions for each satellite were obtained from its respective sources. 

An example is included (BandSimulation.R) with a subset of the freely available Rrs data from GLORIA dataset Lehmann et al. (2023) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-01973-y) 


For running this package in R you can download the archive or use the gitclone function. After that, open the project directory and run the `bandsSimulation` file.
