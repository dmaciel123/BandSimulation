# BandSimulation
 
This package is used for simulating the bands of remote sensors based on they respective Spectral Response Functions. The satellites/sensors added to this package are: 

Landsat-5/TM

Landsat-7/ETM+

Landsat-8/OLI

Sentinel-2/MSI A and B

Sentinel-3/OLCI

PlanetScope SuperDove

The Spectral Response Functions for each satellite were obtained from its respective sources. 

An example is included (BandSimulation.R) with the freely available Rrs data from Drayson et al. (2022) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922006837)
